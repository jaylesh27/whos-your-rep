The goal of this app is to take input from the user and returns a list of the representatives to congress.  The user will enter their zip code and the app will return a list of the representatives from your state.  We will be using Google Maps API and Propublica API.  The app will display basic info on the reps obtained from Propublica such as name, state, party affiliation, twitter handle, and government web page.  A picture will also be displayed with each bio.
